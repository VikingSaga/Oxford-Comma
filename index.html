    <h1>The Oxford Comma</h1>
    <h4> While some say that use of the Oxford Comma is optional, others know the truth. The Oxford Comma enhances clarity, and may even save someone's life and dignity.</h4>
    <h2>Believe it or not this could be a life and death matter. Dear ones please pay close attention: What does "Let's eat grandma" mean? That we are cannibals who think nothing of making our beloved relatives into a yummy dinner? Or, are we inviting our grandma to enjoy a pleasant meal with us... eating something other than her? The solution is to use a comma: "Let's eat, grandma." Now grandma doesn't need to worry.</h2>

    <h3>How about: " I would like to thank my parents, the Pope and the Dalai Lama." What does this mean? How do your real parents feel about being usurped by such eminences? If you meant to thank the Pope and the Dalai Lama, as well as your parents, it would be clearer to say "I would like to thank my parents, the Pope, and the Dalai Lama." </h3>
